    			Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, using any part of their 
    			bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal.Football is the world’s
				most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.<br><br>Football is thought to date back as far as 2500 BC, when the Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and
				Romans played games involving a ball and feet. Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. 
				Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules.<br><br>
				As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge.
				FIFA became a member of the International Football Association Board of Great Britain in 1913.

    			Any list of soccer's all-time greats begins with Pelé, whose supernatural gifts raised the bar for what was possible on the pitch. He is just 17 when he burst on the
				scene with Brazil's first World Cup victory in 1958.<br><br>
				While Pelé is generally considered the game's most famous player, there are those who swear by their left foot that Diego Maradona was the superior talent.
				The Napoli faithful in Italy likely agree, after the diminutive playmaker led the club to their first two league titles and a UEFA Cup win by 1990.<br><br> 
				David Beckham also another iconic palyer renowned for his long-range marksmanship, and in particular his signature free kicks, 
				the midfielder starred on six title-winning teams for Manchester United, twice finishing runner-up for the FIFA Player of the Year Award.<br><br>
				Famous modern time iconic players are Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.
